# christmas-app

This is my first web application project.


Here I put emphasis on the process of making mistakes and fixing them in the stage of double-checking.
Starting from clumsy, inelegant but working solutions I aim to make it smart, pretty and simple. 

LET THE ROCK OFF BEGIN!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The application performs a draw of nicknames in a group of registered players.

It consits of:
- admin pannel which displays the list of registered players together with names of drawn persons. It also allow
admin to start the game whereby drawing button on each user's profile is enabled as well as further registration or alteration of any data by users are disabled. Also, until this button is clicked, admin can delete each player separately. Otherwise the option disappear to avoid a mess. There is also the button to delete all the players which in fact starts new game.

- sign-up pannel to let people enter to the game. (Disabbled when admin starts the play)
- sign-in pannel to let players log-in to their profile. The drawing button is disabled until
admin starts the game. Each player can draw one time per game.
